TASC: topic-adaptive sentiment classification
======================================

This is a parallel implementation of multiple-label classification based on Spark MLlib. 

### Overview <br />

    内部循环选择添加非标注数据集
    1.将训练数据split成文本特征和非文本特征训练数据
    2.全局选择非标注数据集，已经被选择过的数据不再被选择
    3.将每轮选择的非标注测试数据集添加到标训练数据集中
     
    外部循环选择添加话题相关情感词
    1.根据当前时刻选择的所有非标注数据集，选择话题相关情感词
    2.然后根据配置文件中的map得到三元组：选择的非标注测试数据集，话题相关情感词 
### build environment
1. As the former writer of this project changed some of the code of spark-mlib_2.10, spark-mllib_2.10-1.1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar should be replaced by the jar we upload here instead of the jar which is generated by the pom. 
2. We recommend the spark-1.3.1-bin-hadoop2.6 to be your running environment.

### sample
We will upload some config sample and feature sample file as an example .
